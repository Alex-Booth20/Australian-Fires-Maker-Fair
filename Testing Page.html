      <h3 style="color:white"> HELP LOCAL BUSINESS </h3> 

      <br> </br>

  <h5 style="color:white"> Athlete, motivational speaker and burns victim Turia Pitt has taken to social media to urge her followers about the importance of helping local businesses that may have been affected by the bushfire crisis. “Once these fires are finally ‘over’, it won’t be over for many of the local businesses in fire-ravaged towns,” she wrote. “A lot of these places (like my home in Mollymook, and Mallacoota, Kangaroo Island, Eden etc) rely on the tourist dollar for their very survival. “So this is what I’m doing. I’ve created @spendwiththem, a place to feature businesses in fire-affected towns. So, if you want to buy something (now, or in the future), check out @spendwiththem and buy something from one of these places.” The page has already garnered over 180,000 followers. You can find it here. </h5>

      <h3 style="color:white"> ADOPT AN ANIMAL </h3> 

      <br> </br>

      <h5 style="color:white"> The World Wildlife Fund have set up a “Help Save Koalas” fund. They explain exactly where your money could go in helping to prevent koalas from becoming extinct: • $50 “could help plant the first 10,000 urgently needed trees in critical koala habitat.” • $75 “could help provide emergency care and medicine for injured koalas affected by bushfires.” • $100 “could help protect existing forest and woodland, and the wildlife that live there.” • $150 “could help pressure governments to strengthen laws that prevent excessive tree-clearing, before it’s too late.” You can donate here.
