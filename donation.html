<h3> HELP LOCAL BUSINESS </h3>

	<p style="color:white"> <h5> Spend With Them
Athlete, motivational speaker and burns victim Turia Pitt has taken to social media to urge her followers about the importance of helping local businesses that may have been affected by the bushfire crisis.
“Once these fires are finally ‘over’, it won’t be over for many of the local businesses in fire-ravaged towns,” she wrote.
“A lot of these places (like my home in Mollymook, and Mallacoota, Kangaroo Island, Eden etc) rely on the tourist dollar for their very survival.
“So this is what I’m doing. I’ve created @spendwiththem, a place to feature businesses in fire-affected towns. So, if you want to buy something (now, or in the future), check out @spendwiththem and buy something from one of these places.”
